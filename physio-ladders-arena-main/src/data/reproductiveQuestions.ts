    question: "Which receptor controls nitric oxide (NO) release to cause vasodilation during penile erection?",
    options: [
      "Leptin receptor",
      "Angiotensin AT1 receptor",
      "Endothelin ETA receptor",
      "Muscarinic receptor"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Muscarinic receptors (specifically M3) on endothelial cells in penile blood vessels respond to acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves. This stimulates nitric oxide synthase to produce NO, which causes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation, leading to erection.",

    question: "After menopause, hormone replacement therapy with estrogen-like compounds is effective in preventing the progression of osteoporosis. What is the mechanism of their protective effect?",
    options: [
      "They stimulate the activity of osteoblasts",
      "They increase absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract",
      "They stimulate calcium reabsorption by the renal tubules",
      "They stimulate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion by the parathyroid gland"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Estrogen primarily prevents bone loss by stimulating osteoblast activity and inhibiting osteoclast activity. This maintains bone formation while reducing bone resorption. While estrogen can influence calcium absorption, its primary anti-osteoporotic effect is through direct action on bone cells.",

    question: "Within minutes after a normal delivery, flow through the foramen ovale decreases dramatically. What is the cause of this change?",
    options: [
      "Increased formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the endocardium",
      "Increased rate of flow through the pulmonary artery",
      "Increased left atrial pressure",
      "Increased right atrial pressure",
      "Increased partial pressure of oxygen (PO2)"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "After birth, lung expansion and increased pulmonary blood flow dramatically increase venous return to the left atrium, raising left atrial pressure above right atrial pressure. This pressure gradient functionally closes the foramen ovale by pushing the septum primum against the septum secundum.",

      "Estrogen and progesterone",
      "Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)",
      "Progesterone and LH"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Endothelin and norepinephrine are vasoconstrictors that antagonize NO-mediated vasodilation. After orgasm, sympathetic nervous system activation releases norepinephrine, and endothelin is released from endothelial cells, both causing vasoconstriction and detumescence.",

      "Testosterone",
      "Progesterone",
      "Dihydrotestosterone"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Thecal cells lack the enzyme aromatase (CYP19A1) required to convert androgens to estrogens. They can produce testosterone and other androgens, but cannot convert them to estradiol. This conversion occurs in granulosa cells, which have aromatase enzyme.",

    question: "A baby is born with a penis, a scrotum with no testes, no vagina, and XX chromosomes. This condition is referred to as hermaphroditism. What could cause this abnormality?",
    options: [
      "Abnormally high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) production by the trophoblast cells",
      "The presence of a testosterone-secreting tumor in the mother's right adrenal gland",
      "Abnormally high levels of LH in the maternal blood",
      "Abnormally low levels of testosterone in the maternal blood",
      "Abnormally low rates of estrogen production by the placenta"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A genetic female (XX) with male external genitalia indicates exposure to high levels of androgens during fetal development. A maternal testosterone-secreting adrenal tumor would expose the female fetus to masculinizing hormones, causing virilization of external genitalia while internal female structures remain absent due to lack of MÃ¼llerian inhibiting substance.",

    question: "A young woman is given daily injections of a substance beginning on the sixteenth day of her normal menstrual cycle and continuing for 3 weeks. As long as the injections continue, she does not menstruate. The injected substance could be which of the following?",
    options: [
      "Testosterone",
      "FSH",
      "An inhibitor of progesterone's actions",
      "A PGE2 inhibitor",
      "HCG"
    ],
    correct: 4,
    explanation: "HCG maintains the corpus luteum, which continues to secrete progesterone and estrogen. This prevents the hormonal withdrawal that triggers menstruation. Starting on day 16 (post-ovulation) and continuing HCG injections would mimic early pregnancy hormone patterns and prevent menstruation.",

      "Mechanically dilating and stimulating the cervix",
      "Administration of oxytocin"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) is essential for cervical ripening and initiation of labor contractions. A PGE2 antagonist would prevent these processes and inhibit labor initiation. Progesterone antagonists, cervical stimulation, and oxytocin would all promote labor.",

      "Closure of ductus arteriosus",
      "An increase in left ventricular pressure",
      "A decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "After birth, lung expansion and oxygenation cause pulmonary vasodilation, dramatically decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance. This reduces the pressure needed to drive blood through the lungs, decreasing pulmonary artery pressure. Closure of ductus arteriosus is a consequence, not a cause, of pressure changes.",

      "Negative feedback on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by progesterone",
      "Negative feedback on GnRH by estradiol",
      "Negative feedback on GnRH from testosterone"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "After ovulation, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary, suppressing GnRH, LH, and FSH secretion. This returns gonadotropin levels to baseline during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.",

      "Inhibin",
      "Estrogen",
      "LH"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Inhibin B is produced by Sertoli cells in response to FSH stimulation. It provides specific negative feedback to the anterior pituitary to suppress FSH secretion, while testosterone primarily inhibits LH through its effects on GnRH.",

    question: "Which of the following is true during the 12-hour period preceding ovulation?",
    options: [
      "A surge of LH is secreted from the pituitary",
      "The surge occurs immediately after the formation of the corpus luteum",
      "The surge is followed immediately by a fall in the plasma concentration of progesterone",
      "The number of developing follicles is increasing"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The LH surge occurs approximately 12-36 hours before ovulation and is triggered by rising estradiol levels from the dominant follicle. The corpus luteum forms AFTER ovulation, not before. The LH surge actually triggers ovulation and subsequent corpus luteum formation.",

      "When the blood concentration of LH is at its highest point",
      "When 12 primary follicles are developing to the antral stage"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Progesterone levels peak during the mid-luteal phase (about 7 days after ovulation) when the corpus luteum is most active. This occurs between ovulation and menstruation. Before ovulation, progesterone levels are low.",

      "A decrease in both progesterone and estrogen",
      "An increase in estradiol"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Menstruation (endometrial sloughing) occurs due to the withdrawal of hormonal support when the corpus luteum regresses, causing sharp decreases in both progesterone and estrogen levels. This hormonal withdrawal triggers endometrial breakdown and menstrual flow.",

    question: "A professional athlete in her mid-20s has not had a menstrual cycle for 5 years, although a bone density scan revealed normal skeletal mineralization. Which fact may explain these observations?",
    options: [
      "She consumes a high-carbohydrate diet",
      "Her grandmother sustained a hip fracture at age 79 years",
      "Her blood pressure is higher than normal",
      "Her plasma estrogen concentration is very low",
      "She has been taking anabolic steroid supplements for 5 years"
    ],
    correct: 4,
    explanation: "Anabolic steroids suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, causing amenorrhea. However, anabolic steroids have androgenic properties that can help maintain bone density despite low estrogen, explaining the normal bone mineralization. Low estrogen alone would typically cause bone loss.",

      "Right atrial pressure",
      "Aortic pressure",
      "Left ventricular pressure"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Right atrial pressure is higher in the fetus due to venous return from the umbilical vein and the need to maintain right-to-left flow through the foramen ovale. After birth, venous return decreases and right atrial pressure drops below left atrial pressure.",

      "5-alpha reductase",
      "Aromatase",
      "Side chain cleavage enzyme"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Aromatase (CYP19A1) converts androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) to estrogens (estradiol and estrone). This is the final and rate-limiting step in estrogen biosynthesis. 17Î²-HSD converts between different forms but doesn't create the estrogen ring structure.",

      "Flow through the ductus arteriosus",
      "Aortic pressure"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Aortic pressure increases after birth due to loss of the low-resistance placental circulation and increased systemic vascular resistance. The fetal aortic pressure is lower because of the placental shunt. Foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus flows decrease after birth.",

      "HCG",
      "Inhibin from the corpus luteum",
      "GnRH from the embryo's hypothalamus"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) from the placenta stimulates fetal testicular testosterone production during early male sexual differentiation. The fetal hypothalamic-pituitary axis is not fully functional early in development, so HCG serves as the LH-like stimulus for testosterone production.",

      "Endometrium",
      "Stromal cells of the ovaries",
      "Anterior pituitary gland"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "During the follicular phase (after menstruation), developing ovarian follicles produce increasing amounts of estradiol as they grow and mature. The corpus luteum has regressed by this time, and the new cycle's estrogen comes from the granulosa cells of developing follicles.",

    question: "A female athlete who took testosterone-like steroids for several months stopped having normal menstrual cycles. What is the best explanation for this observation?",
    options: [
      "Testosterone stimulates inhibin production from the corpus luteum",
      "Testosterone binds to receptors in the endometrium, resulting in the failure of the endometrium to develop during the normal cycle",

      "Testosterone inhibits the hypothalamic secretion of GnRH and the pituitary secretion of LH and FSH"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Exogenous androgens (testosterone-like steroids) suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis through negative feedback, inhibiting GnRH, LH, and FSH secretion. This disrupts the normal ovarian cycle and causes amenorrhea (absence of menstruation).",

      "Testosterone",
      "Inhibin"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Inhibin B from Sertoli cells provides specific negative feedback on FSH secretion. Since FSH stimulates aromatase activity in Sertoli cells (which convert testosterone to estradiol), reduced FSH leads to decreased local estradiol production in the testes.",

      "Her ovaries continue to secrete estrogen",
      "She took birth control pills for 20 years before menopause"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen provides negative feedback to suppress FSH secretion, preventing the typical post-menopausal rise in FSH. Without HRT, FSH levels would be elevated due to loss of ovarian estrogen production and its negative feedback effect.",
